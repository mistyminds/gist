Great, I’ll conduct an in-depth academic-oriented analysis of LLM inference techniques, covering various dimensions relevant to both cloud and edge deployments. I’ll use arXiv papers as much as possible and include benchmark comparisons where available. I’ll get back to you with a comprehensive report shortly.

# Large Language Model Inference: Cloud and Edge Optimizations

**Abstract:** *Large Language Model (LLM) inference can be highly resource-intensive, but a surge of recent techniques is making it more efficient for both cloud and edge deployments. In this report, we survey key optimizations across multiple fronts: memory-efficient **key-value (KV) caching** for high-throughput serving, methods to **serve Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** models with minimal overhead, advanced **GPU task scheduling** for single- and multi-GPU systems (including overlap of communication and compute, NUMA-aware placement, and offloading strategies), **model architecture innovations** such as sparse Mixture-of-Experts and multi-head latent attention for inference efficiency, **computation optimizations** via mixed precision and quantization, and **compiler/runtime enhancements** (Triton, MLIR, TVM, TensorRT, XLA) that boost performance on diverse hardware. We include benchmark comparisons (latency, throughput, memory, power) to illustrate the impact of these techniques. Finally, we highlight emerging trends – from speculative decoding for low-latency single-user inference to ultra-long context support – outlining future directions for optimizing LLM inference in both cloud datacenters and resource-constrained edge environments.*

## 1. KV Cache Efficiencies

### Multi-Tenant KV Batching and Memory Management

In autoregressive LLM inference, each generated token relies on attention **key and value (KV) caches** storing the model’s previous token outputs. These caches grow with sequence length and consume substantial GPU memory ([vLLM: Easy, Fast, and Cheap LLM Serving with PagedAttention | vLLM Blog](https://blog.vllm.ai/2023/06/20/vllm.html#:~:text=referred to as KV cache,The KV cache is)). In multi-user cloud settings, batching many requests together is crucial for throughput, but existing systems struggle because each request’s KV cache is large (e.g. up to **1.7 GB** for one LLaMA-13B sequence) and dynamically sized ([vLLM: Easy, Fast, and Cheap LLM Serving with PagedAttention | vLLM Blog](https://blog.vllm.ai/2023/06/20/vllm.html#:~:text=referred to as KV cache,The KV cache is)). Inefficient management leads to severe **memory fragmentation and over-allocation** – studies found **60–80% of GPU memory** can be wasted with naive allocation ([vLLM: Easy, Fast, and Cheap LLM Serving with PagedAttention | vLLM Blog](https://blog.vllm.ai/2023/06/20/vllm.html#:~:text=,reservation)). This waste limits the number of concurrent sequences (batch size) and thus throttles throughput ([[2309.06180\] Efficient Memory Management for Large Language Model Serving with PagedAttention](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2309.06180#:~:text=High throughput serving of large,Our evaluations)).

**PagedAttention (vLLM)** addresses this by treating GPU memory like virtual memory pages ([vLLM: Easy, Fast, and Cheap LLM Serving with PagedAttention | vLLM Blog](https://blog.vllm.ai/2023/06/20/vllm.html#:~:text=To address this problem%2C we,and fetches these blocks efficiently)). Instead of reserving one contiguous buffer per sequence, it **partitions each KV cache into fixed-size blocks** that need not be contiguous ([vLLM: Easy, Fast, and Cheap LLM Serving with PagedAttention | vLLM Blog](https://blog.vllm.ai/2023/06/20/vllm.html#:~:text=match at L65 PagedAttention partitions,and fetches these blocks efficiently)). A page table maps logical sequence positions to physical blocks, enabling on-demand allocation as new tokens arrive ([vLLM: Easy, Fast, and Cheap LLM Serving with PagedAttention | vLLM Blog](https://blog.vllm.ai/2023/06/20/vllm.html#:~:text=Because the blocks do not,as new tokens are generated)). This yields near-zero fragmentation – wasted memory is under **4%**, versus up to 80% before ([vLLM: Easy, Fast, and Cheap LLM Serving with PagedAttention | vLLM Blog](https://blog.vllm.ai/2023/06/20/vllm.html#:~:text=generated)). It also permits **memory sharing**: if multiple requests share a prompt or initial tokens (e.g. for generating multiple completions), they can point to the same KV blocks for that prefix ([vLLM: Easy, Fast, and Cheap LLM Serving with PagedAttention | vLLM Blog](https://blog.vllm.ai/2023/06/20/vllm.html#:~:text=PagedAttention has another key advantage%3A,shared between the output sequences)). By eliminating redundant duplication, PagedAttention allows far more sequences to be batched in GPU memory. The result is a **drastic throughput increase**: Kwon *et al.* report vLLM (with PagedAttention) achieves **2–4× higher throughput** than prior optimized systems (NVIDIA FasterTransformer, Orca) at equal latency ([[2309.06180\] Efficient Memory Management for Large Language Model Serving with PagedAttention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180#:~:text=algorithm inspired by the classical,available at this https URL)). Against a standard HuggingFace implementation, vLLM’s gains are even larger – up to **24× throughput** improvement in single-output scenarios ([vLLM: Easy, Fast, and Cheap LLM Serving with PagedAttention | vLLM Blog](https://blog.vllm.ai/2023/06/20/vllm.html#:~:text=Image    19,5x higher throughput than TGI)). Table 1 summarizes how better KV memory management boosts multi-tenant serving performance.

**KV cache compression** is another approach to relieve memory and bandwidth bottlenecks. Recent research quantizes the stored keys/values to lower bit-width. *Oaken* (2024) uses a hybrid offline/online method to quantize KV to mostly **4-bit** values while preserving outlier information in higher precision ([Oaken: Fast and Efficient LLM Serving with Online-Offline Hybrid KV Cache Quantization](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.18599v1#:~:text=further intensifying the pressures on,negating the advantages of quantization)) ([Oaken: Fast and Efficient LLM Serving with Online-Offline Hybrid KV Cache Quantization](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.18599v1#:~:text=Inspired by these insights%2C we,memory management units that can)). The custom hardware design in Oaken achieves **1.58×** throughput improvement over an A100 GPU at batch size 256 with minimal accuracy loss ([Oaken: Fast and Efficient LLM Serving with Online-Offline Hybrid KV Cache Quantization](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.18599v1#:~:text=offline hybrid approach%2C setting outlier,incurring a minimal accuracy loss)). Even without specialized hardware, int8 quantization of KV caches can reduce memory usage 2×, allowing more context or concurrent sessions per GPU. **Multi-Query Attention (MQA)** is an architectural tweak that also shrinks KV size: instead of each attention head producing its own keys and values, MQA shares a single set of KV across all heads (or groups of heads). This reduces KV memory and bandwidth roughly proportional to the number of heads (e.g. 8× less for 8-head grouping) with negligible quality loss – it has been adopted in some LLMs to enable longer context lengths on memory-limited hardware ([TransMLA: Multi-head Latent Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07864v1#:~:text=Modern large language models ,Deepseek V2%2FV3%2FR1%2C many major model)) ([TransMLA: Multi-head Latent Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07864v1#:~:text=to adopt MLA,effective distillation of Deepseek R1)).

**Cloud vs Edge:** In a cloud multi-tenant server, these KV optimizations translate directly to lower cost (more throughput per GPU) and the ability to serve longer prompts. In an edge device (single user) scenario, **real-time latency** is the priority – large batches can’t be formed, but KV caching still provides huge speedups by avoiding recomputation of self-attention for previous tokens. Even for a single long sequence, caching makes generation complexity linear in output length instead of quadratic. Memory can still be a concern on edge (which often has <8 GB), so techniques like MQA and KV quantization are valuable to fit models with longer context windows. If memory is extremely constrained, an edge device might offload old KV to host memory or truncate context to manage footprint. In summary, efficient KV caching benefits both cloud (throughput, concurrency) and edge (latency for long prompts), although the specific strategies might differ (cloud systems emphasize memory pooling across users, whereas edge devices emphasize compact caches for a single session).

### Single-User Real-Time Optimizations

When only one user or request is running (common on edge or low-load scenarios), maximal throughput via large batching is irrelevant – instead the goal is **minimizing per-token latency** and utilizing hardware efficiently despite the inherently sequential workload. One emerging solution is **speculative decoding**, which parallelizes the generation of multiple tokens ahead of time using a draft model. For example, a smaller “assistant” model can predict several likely next tokens in one go, and the large model then verifies or corrects the draft in one forward pass, effectively leaping ahead several tokens per iteration. Spector and Ré (2023) propose a two-stage speculative decoding algorithm that restructures the generation into a tree of possibilities ([[2308.04623\] Accelerating LLM Inference with Staged Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04623#:~:text=diverse capabilities,while perfectly preserving output quality)). In a small-batch on-device test, their method achieved a **3.16× reduction in latency** for single-batch decoding (GPT-2, 762M parameters) with **no quality loss** ([[2308.04623\] Accelerating LLM Inference with Staged Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04623#:~:text=diverse capabilities,while perfectly preserving output quality)). This technique is especially relevant for edge devices or any scenario where we can’t batch multiple independent queries – it trades some extra compute (running a faster draft model) to significantly cut wall-clock time, effectively **boosting single-stream throughput ~3×**.

Another single-user optimization is ensuring the model kernels themselves are highly efficient. Techniques like **FlashAttention** (which uses tiling and lower precision in attention computation) can reduce latency per token by optimizing GPU memory access patterns, thereby speeding up each inference step ([Mastering LLM Techniques: Inference Optimization](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/mastering-llm-techniques-inference-optimization/#:~:text=Mastering LLM Techniques%3A Inference Optimization,along with some practical solutions)) ([Compilers: Talking to The Hardware - Unify AI](https://unify.ai/blog/deep-learning-compilers#:~:text=Compilers%3A Talking to The Hardware,within neural networks into)). Ensuring **pipeline parallelism** (if the model is split across GPUs) is done with minimal stalls (discussed in §3) is also crucial so that even one request keeps all devices busy. On edge hardware without GPUs, using model distillation (smaller models) or quantization (int8 arithmetic on CPUs/NPUs) is often necessary to get real-time responses. For instance, int8 execution on CPUs can be *faster* than FP16/FP32 by leveraging vectorized integer instructions, and is **far more power-efficient** (8-bit ops use significantly less energy and memory bandwidth than 16-bit or 32-bit) ([Understanding FP32, FP16, and INT8 Precision in Deep Learning ...](https://medium.com/@vishalindev/understanding-fp32-fp16-and-int8-precision-in-deep-learning-models-why-int8-calibration-is-5406b1c815a8#:~:text=,power devices)) (). In fact, quantized models can be **2–8× more efficient** in energy than FP32 models on specialized hardware (), a critical factor for battery-powered devices.

**Summary:** Efficient KV caching is a cornerstone for high-performance LLM inference. In cloud settings, innovations like paging, sharing, and quantizing the cache enable high-throughput multi-tenant serving ([[2309.06180\] Efficient Memory Management for Large Language Model Serving with PagedAttention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180#:~:text=algorithm inspired by the classical,available at this https URL)) ([Oaken: Fast and Efficient LLM Serving with Online-Offline Hybrid KV Cache Quantization](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.18599v1#:~:text=offline hybrid approach%2C setting outlier,incurring a minimal accuracy loss)). In edge and single-user cases, while caches still help, additional strategies like speculative decoding and model compression come into play to achieve low latency. These methods complement each other – a cloud server might simultaneously apply KV paging for memory efficiency and run a speculative decoding algorithm to handle bursts of interactive requests with low latency. The end result is a more responsive and resource-efficient LLM service across the board.

## 2. Serving LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) Efficiently

**Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** is a popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that trains small rank-decomposition matrices (adapters) to be added to the original model weights. At inference, applying a LoRA adapter means adding an extra low-rank transformation at each layer (e.g. `W_eff = W + ΔW` with ΔW = $U V^T$ of rank $r$) (). This allows deploying many domain-specific variants of an LLM without copying the entire model for each – only the compact LoRA weights (often <1% of model size) differ. However, serving LoRA-enhanced models introduces challenges in both **integration** and **multi-tenant scalability**.

A naïve approach for a single LoRA is to **merge** the LoRA weights into the base model weights once and run inference as usual (this effectively “bakes in” the adaptation). This incurs zero runtime overhead, but it becomes impractical if many different LoRA variants must be served concurrently (e.g. different users each with a custom fine-tune) (). Merging would require loading a separate copy of the  model for each LoRA, multiplying memory usage. Thus, cloud providers prefer a **runtime LoRA application**, where one base model can serve requests with different adapters by injecting the LoRA computations on the fly.

The straightforward way to apply LoRA at runtime is to compute the LoRA's contribution at each layer for each forward pass. If done on GPU, this means performing additional small matrix multiplies and additions per layer. If done on CPU (to save GPU memory), it involves transferring activations between GPU and CPU every layer – which can be very slow. Indeed, Li *et al.* (2024) found that a naive CPU-offloaded LoRA setup can increase inference latency by **79.4%** due to frequent cross-device calls and synchronization costs (). Furthermore, loading a LoRA adapter into memory on-demand can cause **cold-start latency**, especially if many small LoRAs are swapped in and out for different requests ().

To solve these issues, researchers have proposed specialized LoRA-serving pipelines. **CaraServe** (2024) is one system that optimizes LoRA inference by **pipelining GPU and CPU computation and minimizing overheads** (). It uses a custom CUDA operator to asynchronously copy activations to CPU and apply LoRA there while the GPU processes the base model, effectively overlapping the two so neither is idle (). It also shares memory between the GPU process and CPU LoRA workers to avoid expensive serialization of data for each layer (). With these techniques, CaraServe cut the per-token LoRA overhead to **under 1 ms**, reducing the initial prompt processing (“prefill”) latency by **57.9%** compared to a naive baseline (). The system further parallelizes LoRA computations across multiple CPU cores to prevent the adapter application from bottlenecking throughput (). Overall, in experiments with LLaMA-2 (7B to 70B) and multiple adapters, CaraServe achieved up to **1.4× faster** average latency than the previous state-of-the-art LoRA serving solution ().

Another line of optimization is at the kernel level. The **S-LoRA** framework introduced a fused GPU kernel for batched LoRA computation (). Instead of applying each adapter sequentially, it uses a technique called **Multi-Batched Giant Matrix-Vector (MBGMV)** multiplication to apply multiple LoRA updates in one batch operation without padding overhead () (). This significantly speeds up scenarios where a single request uses multiple small LoRAs or when batching together requests that use different LoRAs. CaraServe further improves scheduling by being *rank-aware*: it profiles how different LoRA ranks (which determine compute cost) impact decoding latency, and then **schedules requests intelligently** so that similar-cost adapters batch together () (). This avoids, for example, a slow high-rank adapter from delaying other fast low-rank ones in the same batch. Their rank-aware scheduling cut average per-token latency by **36.4%** and achieved 99% SLA attainment in tests ().

**Cloud vs Edge:** In cloud multi-tenant environments, these optimizations allow a single base model to serve many personalized versions efficiently. A practical example is a chatbot service where each customer fine-tunes a base model with LoRA – the serving system can load all the small LoRA modules and dynamically compose them with the base model per request. Batching can even mix requests with different LoRAs on one GPU, as long as the serving stack handles the varying compute (CaraServe’s scheduler ensures mixed batches don’t violate latency targets ()). The benefit is enormous memory savings: dozens of variants share one set of base weights, rather than storing dozens of full model copies. On the edge, the situation is usually simpler – a device might have one or a few LoRA-adapted models that a user cares about. In that case, the edge device can afford to merge the LoRA into the model weights ahead of time (since it’s just for one domain or user) and avoid runtime overhead entirely. However, if the device needs to rapidly switch between multiple modes (each a different LoRA), approaches like on-device caching of adapter weights and using a fused kernel to apply them could be useful. One interesting edge scenario is federated or personal models: a base model runs mostly on device with personal LoRAs (for user-specific data). Here, keeping the base model frozen and only swapping/adding LoRAs might save memory. Ensuring the LoRA application is efficient (perhaps using the device NPU for the extra matmul) would be key to maintaining responsiveness.

In summary, serving LoRA-enhanced LLMs efficiently requires minimizing the overhead of those small but frequent computations. Solutions combine **systems techniques** (overlap, scheduling, memory sharing) with **kernel optimizations** (fused operations) to make multi-adapter inference nearly as fast as a single model () (). These advances let cloud providers offer many fine-tuned “versions” of an LLM without excessive cost, and allow edge users to benefit from lightweight customization of models without large latency penalties.

## 3. Task Scheduling and GPU Utilization

Optimizing how inference tasks are scheduled on hardware is critical for both **throughput and latency**. Large models and unpredictable request patterns pose scheduling challenges that don’t arise in simpler ML serving. We examine scheduling on a single GPU, scaling across multiple GPUs, overlapping communication with computation, NUMA and locality considerations, and offloading strategies.

### Single-GPU vs. Multi-GPU Scheduling

On a single GPU, the goal is to maximize utilization while meeting latency constraints. **Dynamic batching** is a common technique in cloud inference servers: incoming requests are queued and grouped so that the GPU processes multiple inputs in one forward pass (leveraging matrix-multiply parallelism). This amortizes the launch overhead and fully utilizes GPU cores, greatly increasing throughput. However, batching introduces a **throughput–latency trade-off**: waiting longer to form a larger batch improves tokens-per-second (TPS) but adds queuing delay for each request. Traditional scheduling either batches at the **request level** (process as many new requests as possible up front, then generate tokens for each) or at the **iteration level** (as in vLLM, always try to batch tokens at each decoding step) () (). A naive scheduler might stall ongoing token generation (“decodes”) whenever a new prompt arrives, to batch it in – this achieves high throughput but causes **latency spikes** for the in-progress requests ().

Recent systems seek to **balance throughput and latency** with smarter scheduling. **Sarathi-Serve** (OSDI 2024) identified pitfalls in existing strategies and introduced *stall-free batching* () (). It uses **chunked-prefill** – splitting a long input prompt into chunks – so that processing a new request’s prompt can be interwoven with ongoing generations instead of halting them entirely () (). By coalescing chunks of new prompts with decode steps of others, Sarathi achieves nearly uniform workload per batch, avoiding idle gaps (). In experiments, this yielded impressive gains: e.g. for a Mistral-7B on one A100 GPU, Sarathi improved serving capacity (QPS under latency SLO) by **2.6×**, and for a larger LLaMA2-70B on multi-GPU, up to **5.6×** higher throughput when pipeline parallelism was used () (). Another system, **Llumnix** (2024), focuses on the issue of load imbalance over time. It allows *live migration* of ongoing requests (with their KV cache state) between GPU instances, using vLLM’s flexible memory management to copy state with near-zero downtime ([Llumnix: Dynamic Scheduling for Large Language Model Serving](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.03243v1#:~:text=Llumnix reschedules requests via an,transfer to hide the cost)) ([Llumnix: Dynamic Scheduling for Large Language Model Serving](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.03243v1#:~:text=We have implemented Llumnix as,when delivering similar tail latencies)). This lets the scheduler rebalance workload on the fly – for example, if one GPU becomes loaded with a slow long sequence, part of that work can be moved to a less busy GPU. Llumnix’s distributed scheduler can prioritize urgent requests and defragment load, improving tail latency significantly. It showed up to **15× reduction in p99 latency** and 36% cost savings at similar latency in a 16-GPU cluster test ([Llumnix: Dynamic Scheduling for Large Language Model Serving](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.03243v1#:~:text=Llumnix currently supports a representative,when delivering similar tail latencies)). These advanced schedulers treat the *token generation loop* as a first-class scheduling unit, rather than just entire requests, which is crucial for LLM workloads.

When scaling to **multi-GPU deployments**, scheduling involves partitioning the model and the work across devices. Large models like GPT-3 175B or PaLM cannot fit on one GPU, so **model parallelism** is used: either tensor parallel (splitting each layer’s matrix among GPUs) or pipeline parallel (different layers on different GPUs). **Pipeline-parallel inference** introduces bubble times because the first token must pass through all layers in sequence across devices before the second token can start. If the prompt (first input) is very long, the pipeline may sit idle on later stages until the prompt is processed entirely by earlier stages ([DéjàVu: KV-cache Streaming for Fast, Fault-tolerant Generative LLM Serving](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.01876v1#:~:text=due to three key challenges%3A,on a range of large)). This is why Sarathi’s chunking of the prefill is useful – it keeps all pipeline stages working more continuously by sending chunks through in an interleaved fashion () (). The authors note this yields more uniform micro-batches and reduces pipeline stalls, which translated to multi-GPU throughput improvements (Falcon-180B with pipeline+tensor parallel saw up to 5.6× gain) () (). Another strategy from **DéjàVu** (OSDI 2024) is *prompt-token disaggregation*: they run the prompt phase in a distributed manner such that once one stage of the pipeline finishes the prompt, it can immediately start generating tokens while the earlier stage continues the rest of the prompt for other partitions ([DéjàVu: KV-cache Streaming for Fast, Fault-tolerant Generative LLM Serving](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.01876v1#:~:text=due to three key challenges%3A,large models across cloud deployments)) ([DéjàVu: KV-cache Streaming for Fast, Fault-tolerant Generative LLM Serving](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.01876v1#:~:text=landscape of ML model serving,the use of KV cache)). This reduces the idle “bubble” at the transition from prompt to generation. Additionally, multi-GPU inference benefits from **concurrent streams** – each GPU can handle multiple sequences in parallel (since modern GPUs can execute multiple CUDA streams). Ensuring the scheduler feeds enough work to each GPU (via batching across requests or splitting a single request if possible) helps keep utilization high.

### Communication–Computation Overlap

When a model is sharded across GPUs or nodes, the inter-GPU communication (such as exchanging activations in tensor parallel or sending outputs to the next pipeline stage) can become a bottleneck. Overlapping communication with computation is a classic HPC optimization that has been applied to LLM inference. In pipeline parallelism, one can *double-buffer* the data transfers: while the GPU is computing on one batch, the next batch’s data is concurrently transferred to it, so that the network latency is hidden behind compute. For example, Microsoft’s DeepSpeed-Inference stack and NVIDIA’s FasterTransformer use CUDA streams and NCCL communication that overlap with layer computations to avoid sequential wait times. **Sarathi-Serve** explicitly mentions creating balanced micro-batches that reduce pipeline bubbles, effectively allowing communication to be naturally overlapped because each stage always has something to compute while waiting for the next token chunk () (). Similarly, **Llumnix’s migration** technique coordinates the copying of a request’s state to another GPU in the background while the model is still generating tokens on the current GPU, achieving the transfer with “near-zero downtime” by careful scheduling ([Llumnix: Dynamic Scheduling for Large Language Model Serving](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.03243v1#:~:text=Llumnix reschedules requests via an,transfer to hide the cost)) ([Llumnix: Dynamic Scheduling for Large Language Model Serving](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.03243v1#:~:text=Straightforward rescheduling approaches could introduce,transfer to hide the cost)).

In tensor-parallel inference (where each layer is split across GPUs and results must be all-reduced), overlapping communication is trickier, but libraries attempt to perform the all-reduce for one layer while the next layer’s computation begins (this requires the framework to segment the work). NVIDIA’s Transformer Engine and Megatron-LM inference kernels schedule GEMMs and reductions in a pipelined fashion to this end. The result of effective overlap is higher effective utilization of networking hardware (NVLink, InfiniBand, etc.) and improved throughput – particularly important in multi-node deployment of very large models. For example, Sarathi’s evaluation on Falcon-180B (8 GPUs over Ethernet) showed substantial throughput gains by minimizing idle times (), implying overlap and scheduling tuned to the communication delays was key.

### NUMA Awareness and Task Locality

In multi-socket CPU systems with attached accelerators (a common cloud server setup), **NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access)** effects can impact inference performance. A GPU is typically connected to one CPU socket (NUMA node); if a process running on a different socket accesses the GPU or its memory, it incurs additional latency. Best practice for inference servers is to achieve **NUMA locality**: pin the GPU-serving threads to the CPU cores on the same socket as that GPU, and allocate any CPU memory buffers (for data preprocessing, I/O, or CPU-offloaded layers) on that NUMA node’s memory. This avoids cross-socket memory traffic which can degrade throughput and increase latency unpredictably. Intel and NVIDIA both emphasize this in their performance guides ([Understanding NUMA Node for Performance Benchmarks](https://enterprise-support.nvidia.com/s/article/understanding-numa-node-for-performance-benchmarks#:~:text=Understanding NUMA Node for Performance,processors on a single)) ([Container Service for Kubernetes:Enable NUMA topology-aware ...](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/2786724.html#:~:text=,NUMA) nodes may)). In a multi-GPU server, locality also means keeping a given user’s request on the **same GPU or GPU set** throughout its lifetime to benefit from cache reuse. For instance, if a second query from the same session comes, scheduling it to the same GPU allows reuse of the KV cache (which is already in that GPU’s memory) instead of starting fresh on another device. This implies a need for **session affinity** in the scheduler. Some systems (like Hugging Face’s text-generation-inference) allow pinning sessions to workers to leverage this cache locality.

Furthermore, if model weights are sharded, they might reside in a combination of GPU and CPU memory (see offloading below). **Task locality** then also means executing the parts of the model where their weights reside to avoid shuttling large weights across the PCIe bus repeatedly. For example, if some transformer layers are offloaded to CPU, it’s preferable to run those computations on the CPU rather than constantly move those layer weights to GPU for each inference. Overall, NUMA-aware allocation and locality-conscious scheduling ensure that we don’t lose the gains from other optimizations due to inadvertent data movement overheads in the system architecture.

### Layer Offloading and Memory–Compute Trade-offs

When models are too large to fully reside in fast memory (GPU VRAM), **offloading strategies** can be used to leverage cheaper but slower memory (CPU RAM or even disk/NVMe). Offloading is essentially a scheduling problem of *when and where* to move parts of the model or its intermediate data during inference. One straightforward approach is **stage-offload**: keep early layers on GPU and offload later layers to CPU, or vice-versa, so that at any given time only a portion of the model is on GPU. The extreme case is running the entire model on CPU – which is often 10-100× slower for LLMs – so more nuanced methods aim to use CPU as overflow memory but still do most compute on GPU.

**FlexGen** (2023) is an example that systematically explores offloading for generative inference. It partitions weights, activations, and the KV cache across the **GPU, CPU, and disk** and uses a scheduling algorithm to stream these pieces in and out as needed for each token ([ FlexGen: High-Throughput Generative Inference of Large Language Models  with a Single GPU ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06865#:~:text=Our focus is designing efficient,we can sacrifice latency by)) ([ FlexGen: High-Throughput Generative Inference of Large Language Models  with a Single GPU ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06865#:~:text=three kinds of tensors%3A weights%2C,2022)). By overlapping I/O with computation and using large batch sizes to amortize transfer costs, FlexGen was able to run a 175B model on a single 16 GB GPU with decent throughput – in some settings achieving 5–10× higher throughput than prior offloading solutions (like DeepSpeed Zero-Inference) which didn’t optimize the I/O scheduling as well ([ FlexGen: High-Throughput Generative Inference of Large Language Models  with a Single GPU ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06865#:~:text=Prior efforts to lower resource,Research in the first two)) ([ FlexGen: High-Throughput Generative Inference of Large Language Models  with a Single GPU ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06865#:~:text=a single commodity GPU,5 TB)). The key insight is to treat the different memory tiers (VRAM, DRAM, disk) as a hierarchy and **allocate each tensor to a level** such that GPU memory holds only the “active” working set at any moment. For example, FlexGen might keep the current layer’s weights on GPU and pre-fetch the next layer’s weights from CPU while computing, then swap out those just-used weights to make room for the subsequent layer, and so on ([ FlexGen: High-Throughput Generative Inference of Large Language Models  with a Single GPU ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06865#:~:text=memory%2C we can offload it,1 shows)) ([ FlexGen: High-Throughput Generative Inference of Large Language Models  with a Single GPU ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06865#:~:text=Achieving high,forms a complex dependency graph)). It also compresses data (e.g., 4-bit quantization of weights and KV) to maximize effective throughput ([ FlexGen: High-Throughput Generative Inference of Large Language Models  with a Single GPU ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06865#:~:text=offloading,weights and activations of LLMs)). The outcome is that very large models can be served with limited GPU memory, at the cost of some latency. In batch-oriented scenarios, FlexGen reached **100× higher throughput** than naive GPU-only or CPU-only approaches by holding a batch of 256 requests in flight and streaming data for all of them efficiently ([ FlexGen: High-Throughput Generative Inference of Large Language Models  with a Single GPU ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06865#:~:text=but scarce%2C while lower levels,to that of the cases)) ([ FlexGen: High-Throughput Generative Inference of Large Language Models  with a Single GPU ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06865#:~:text=Achieving high,layer structure of the computation)).

More recent work like **LM-Offload** (2023) and **FlexInfer** (2024) have further improved on these ideas, using performance models to decide which tensors to offload and when. LM-Offload, for instance, claims up to **2.95× speedup** over FlexGen by smarter scheduling of I/O and compute ([[PDF\] LM-Offload: Performance Model-Guided Generative Inference of ...](http://pasalabs.org/papers/2024/llm_offload_2024.pdf#:~:text=[PDF] LM,34×)). Techniques such as **PagedAttention** (from §1) can complement offloading – e.g. by “paging out” rarely accessed KV cache pages to CPU memory if context is extremely long, or by keeping only hot experts of an MoE model in GPU memory (as one paper did) ([Toward Efficient Inference for Mixture of Experts | OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=stXtBqyTWX&noteId=p7ADDxdU8g#:~:text=for LM%2C 5.75,com%2Fhyhuang00%2Fmoe_inference)) ([Toward Efficient Inference for Mixture of Experts | OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=stXtBqyTWX&noteId=p7ADDxdU8g#:~:text=for MT,com%2Fhyhuang00%2Fmoe_inference)). Offloading is essentially about *trading latency for capacity*: cloud providers may accept some increase in response time to enable serving a larger model or more concurrent sessions per GPU, which can be a net win in cost. On the edge, offloading might mean using host memory when the on-device accelerator (like a mobile GPU or NPU) runs out of its limited RAM. For example, some mobile frameworks will move layers to CPU execution if they can’t fit the model fully on the DSP. This hurts latency significantly, so a better approach on edge is often to compress or distill the model to avoid offloading in the first place. Still, for enabling say a 30B model on a phone with 8GB RAM, one might offload half the layers to CPU and only run the attention blocks on the GPU.

**Layer offloading strategies** also include **activation checkpointing** during long sequences – dropping or recomputing activations on the fly to save memory (commonly used in training, but could be applied in limited form to inference if memory is a bigger issue than compute). And with new **processing-in-memory (PIM)** hardware (some research proposes putting attention computation in memory near DRAM ([Long-Context LLM Decoding with Scalable DRAM-PIM System - arXiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.20166#:~:text=Long,effectiveness of the proposed)) ([Long-Context LLM Decoding with Scalable DRAM-PIM System - arXiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.20166#:~:text=standalone and heterogeneous systems%2C demonstrating,effectiveness of the proposed))), one could offload certain operations to where the data is stored, reducing data movement.

In summary, efficient scheduling for LLM inference spans a range: from fine-grained token-level scheduling on a single GPU (to optimize latency/throughput) (), to macro-level decisions of how to allocate model parts across multiple GPUs or memory tiers ([ FlexGen: High-Throughput Generative Inference of Large Language Models  with a Single GPU ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06865#:~:text=three kinds of tensors%3A weights%2C,2022)). Cutting-edge systems like Sarathi and Llumnix show that treating the generation process dynamically (rather than a fixed sequence of operations) yields substantial improvements in both latency and throughput () ([Llumnix: Dynamic Scheduling for Large Language Model Serving](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.03243v1#:~:text=We have implemented Llumnix as,when delivering similar tail latencies)). For cloud deployment, these scheduling innovations mean better SLA compliance and higher hardware utilization. For edge, they mean squeezing the most out of limited resources (e.g. ensuring the small accelerator is never idle and not bogged down by unnecessary data transfers). Table 2 highlights some representative scheduling improvements reported in recent literature:

These results illustrate how rethinking scheduling and execution order can unlock major efficiency gains in LLM inference. As models and contexts grow, such techniques will be increasingly indispensable to meet real-time requirements.

## 4. Model Architecture Efficiencies for Inference

The design of the model architecture itself plays a huge role in inference efficiency. Traditional dense Transformers use every parameter for every token, which can be wasteful and slow for very large models. Researchers are exploring architectures that are **sparser or otherwise optimized** to reduce the amount of computation per token, as well as those that reduce memory overhead (e.g. from attention).

### Sparse Models and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)

**Mixture-of-Experts** models introduce sparsity by having multiple “expert” sub-networks and a gating mechanism that activates only a subset of them per input. For instance, Google’s Switch Transformer (Fedus et al. 2021) had up to 64 experts per layer but routed each token through only **one** expert’s feed-forward network, effectively using 1/64 of the parameters for that token (plus negligible gating cost). This means the model can have a very high parameter count (and capacity) while the **inference FLOPs per token are much lower** than an equivalent-size dense model. The potential speedup is significant especially at large scales: if 64 experts are used and each token sees 1 expert, one could get up to ~64× throughput *if* the system can handle the load balancing and memory. In practice, MoE inference has challenges: unequal load (some experts might get chosen more often, causing straggler slowdowns), communication overhead to gather token batches for each expert, and the sheer memory of storing so many parameters (which often must be sharded across multiple GPUs).

Recent work has specifically targeted MoE inference optimization. Huang *et al.* (2024) identify inefficiencies and propose three techniques: **dynamic gating, expert buffering, and improved load balancing** ([Toward Efficient Inference for Mixture of Experts | OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=stXtBqyTWX&noteId=p7ADDxdU8g#:~:text=model size and complex communication,new caching mechanism that only)). **Dynamic gating** allows the fraction of experts used to vary with load – effectively routing more tokens to fewer experts when underutilized to save overhead, and spreading out when needed. They showed this can improve max throughput by **6.2× to 11.6×** for language model inference, compared to static gating, by keeping more uniform utilization of experts ([Toward Efficient Inference for Mixture of Experts | OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=stXtBqyTWX&noteId=p7ADDxdU8g#:~:text=namely ,com%2Fhyhuang00%2Fmoe_inference)). They also reduce memory usage by up to 1.36× by dynamically limiting active experts ([Toward Efficient Inference for Mixture of Experts | OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=stXtBqyTWX&noteId=p7ADDxdU8g#:~:text=We show that dynamic gating,new caching mechanism that only)). **Expert buffering** is a clever idea to handle the memory footprint: only keep the “hot” experts (recently or frequently used) in GPU memory, while parking inactive experts’ weights in CPU memory (or disk) until needed ([Toward Efficient Inference for Mixture of Experts | OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=stXtBqyTWX&noteId=p7ADDxdU8g#:~:text=for LM%2C 5.75,com%2Fhyhuang00%2Fmoe_inference)). This was shown to cut static GPU memory needs by ~1.47×, with minimal latency impact if the gating rarely calls the cold experts ([Toward Efficient Inference for Mixture of Experts | OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=stXtBqyTWX&noteId=p7ADDxdU8g#:~:text=for LM%2C 5.75,com%2Fhyhuang00%2Fmoe_inference)). Combined with a load-balancing algorithm to prevent any one expert from getting too many tokens, these techniques make MoEs more practical to deploy. In essence, MoEs trade off extra system complexity (for routing and potential weight swapping) to **dramatically reduce per-token compute**. In a well-tuned MoE (e.g. GLaM or BASE layers from literature), one can see higher throughput than a dense model of similar accuracy, especially at large batch sizes where the overhead of parallel expert processing is amortized ([Toward Efficient Inference for Mixture of Experts - OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=stXtBqyTWX&noteId=p7ADDxdU8g#:~:text=OpenReview openreview,It)) ([A Visual Guide to Mixture of Experts (MoE)](https://newsletter.maartengrootendorst.com/p/a-visual-guide-to-mixture-of-experts#:~:text=A Visual Guide to Mixture,based architectures)).

For cloud inference, MoEs are attractive when extremely high throughput is needed for certain tasks or when model capacity (knowledge) has to be scaled beyond what dense models can achieve. Google’s GShard MoE and GLaM were used to serve tasks at lower cost per query by not executing all weights for every input. That said, MoEs typically require multi-GPU (or TPU) deployment because a single device cannot hold all experts, and the communication to shuttle tokens to experts needs an efficient high-bandwidth interconnect. Thus MoEs make more sense in cloud datacenters than on edge. On edge devices, the total model size would be prohibitive (unless one imagines a tiny MoE where the experts are small, but then the benefit diminishes). For edge scenarios, **pruning** is a related concept – you can prune a dense model’s weights to introduce sparsity, then use sparse computation libraries to skip the zero weights. NVIDIA’s Ampere GPUs, for example, have support for 2:4 structured sparsity (if you prune 50% of weights in a certain pattern, the hardware doubles throughput). Pruned models or distilling an MoE into a smaller dense model might be ways to get some MoE benefits on edge.

### Multi-Head Latent Attention and Efficient Attention Mechanisms

The self-attention mechanism is a major contributor to inference cost and memory usage, scaling with sequence length. Each attention head produces its own Key and Value vectors for each token, which (as discussed in §1) leads to large KV caches. **Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)** is a novel architecture that tackles this by reducing redundancy across heads. Meng *et al.* (2024) observed that multiple attention heads often encode redundant information, and the communication bottleneck of copying all those per-head KV vectors is significant ([TransMLA: Multi-head Latent Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07864v1#:~:text=Modern large language models ,Deepseek V2%2FV3%2FR1%2C many major model)). MLA introduces a low-rank latent projection in the key/value layers: essentially compressing the keys and values into a **lower-dimensional latent space** that is shared, while maintaining multiple query heads for expressiveness ([TransMLA: Multi-head Latent Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07864v1#:~:text=Modern large language models ,Deepseek V2%2FV3%2FR1%2C many major model)) ([TransMLA: Multi-head Latent Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07864v1#:~:text=Latent Attention ,be represented by MLA with)). After computing attention in this latent space, an up-projection matrix reconstructs the outputs for each head’s context ([TransMLA: Multi-head Latent Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07864v1#:~:text=Latent Attention ,be represented by MLA with)). The net effect is that the KV cache (and attention computation) operates in a smaller space, significantly reducing memory and bandwidth requirements, at the cost of some extra linear operations for the projections. This trade-off **reduces communication overhead** (e.g. between GPU and CPU or between neural cores) and can speed up inference when memory bandwidth was the limiter ([TransMLA: Multi-head Latent Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07864v1#:~:text=Modern large language models ,Deepseek V2%2FV3%2FR1%2C many major model)). The authors report that MLA greatly reduces KV cache size compared to standard multi-head attention and can accelerate inference accordingly ([TransMLA: Multi-head Latent Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07864v1#:~:text=Modern large language models ,Deepseek V2%2FV3%2FR1%2C many major model)) ([TransMLA: Multi-head Latent Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07864v1#:~:text=states,training method that converts widely)). Importantly, they show that **Grouped Query Attention (GQA)** – a simpler method where keys/values are shared by groups of heads (also called multi-query attention) – is actually a special case of their MLA framework ([TransMLA: Multi-head Latent Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07864v1#:~:text=demonstrated efficiency and effectiveness in,Additionally%2C we)). GQA has already been adopted in large models like PaLM to allow longer sequences by cutting KV memory usage (PaLM used one KV per 8 heads, drastically shrinking memory with minimal loss). MLA extends this idea with learned low-rank factors that potentially capture more nuance than simple head grouping.

From an inference perspective, both GQA and MLA mean **fewer KV vectors to store and fetch** for each token generation, which can directly improve throughput when many contexts are in memory. These techniques are especially useful for long-context LLMs (30k+ tokens) where KV cache becomes the dominant memory use. By compressing KV, one can achieve longer context on the same hardware or faster retrieval from memory (e.g., an MLA cache might be small enough to stay in HBM (GPU memory) whereas a full KV would spill to DDR4).

Beyond KV compression, there are other **attention-efficient architectures**: for instance, **Sparse Attention** patterns (as used in Longformer, BigBird, etc.) reduce compute by only attending to a subset of tokens (like local window + global tokens). This can lower the complexity from O(n^2) to O(n) or O(n log n) for long sequences, greatly speeding up inference on long texts. However, for short sequences, the constant factors might not pay off. **Retrieval-based models** can also be seen as architecture optimizations – instead of increasing model size to encode all facts, keep the model smaller and use a retrieval system to fetch relevant text from a database, which the model then attends to. This can improve quality without a heavier model, indirectly making inference lighter (since external memory does some of the work). For example, Atlas and Retro models incorporate retrieval to reduce the param count needed for a given level of performance.

**Architectures designed explicitly for fast inference** often try to simplify the computation graph. One example is replacing softmax attention with alternatives (like linearized attention, or the recent Recurrent Memory Transformer) that avoid the quadratic scaling. Another example is using an **RNN or stateful mechanism** instead of full self-attention, so that each new token update is O(1) work – the RWKV model is a variant that behaves like an RNN but achieves transformer-like performance, and it can be more efficient for single-stream inference since it doesn’t need to build up a huge attention context. Similarly, **FlashAttention** (though more of an implementation optimization) could be considered an architectural improvement as it allows attention to be computed in a way that uses less memory, enabling larger batch or sequence on same hardware ([Mastering LLM Techniques: Inference Optimization](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/mastering-llm-techniques-inference-optimization/#:~:text=Mastering LLM Techniques%3A Inference Optimization,along with some practical solutions)).

In summary, architecture choices like MoE and MLA can yield **order-of-magnitude efficiency gains** for inference under the right conditions ([Toward Efficient Inference for Mixture of Experts | OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=stXtBqyTWX&noteId=p7ADDxdU8g#:~:text=namely ,com%2Fhyhuang00%2Fmoe_inference)) ([TransMLA: Multi-head Latent Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07864v1#:~:text=Modern large language models ,Deepseek V2%2FV3%2FR1%2C many major model)). Cloud providers are actively exploring MoE for its potential to reduce per-token compute of huge models, and techniques like multi-query or latent attention are already trickling into deployed models to handle longer contexts efficiently. On the edge, lighter architectures (distilled models, efficient attention variants) are key to fitting within tight latency and memory budgets. For example, mobile-optimized BERT variants (TinyBERT, MobileBERT) achieve similar accuracy to BERT with a fraction of the compute by architectural streamlining. As LLMs evolve, we expect to see more heterogeneity in architecture – not one giant transformer for all, but specialized forms that maximize inference performance for specific use cases (sparse experts for throughput, compressed attention for long text, etc.). The challenge is ensuring these new architectures still maintain the accuracy and flexibility we expect from LLMs.

## 5. Computation Efficiencies: Precision and Quantization

While architecture sets the upper bound on efficiency, **lower-level computation optimizations** can significantly speed up inference without altering the model’s behavior. Chief among these are using reduced precision arithmetic and quantization of model parameters, which exploit the tolerance of neural networks to numerical approximation.

### Mixed Precision Inference (FP16/BF16/FP8)

It is now standard practice to run inference in **16-bit floating point** rather than full 32-bit precision. Modern GPUs have fast tensor core units that multiply FP16 (or Bfloat16) matrices much faster than FP32. By using FP16 for weights and activations, one can double the throughput and halve memory usage with typically **no observable loss in output quality** for LLMs ([LLM.int8(): 8-bit Matrix Multiplication for Transformers at Scale - arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07339#:~:text=arXiv arxiv,without any performance degradation)). For example, GPT-3 and PaLM can be served in FP16 yielding identical generated text as FP32. Bfloat16 is an alternative 16-bit format with a wider exponent range; many choose BF16 for its training stability, but for inference it behaves similarly to FP16 in speed. The benefit is not just speed but also memory and bandwidth savings – a 175B model in FP16 is ~350 GB vs 700 GB in FP32, enabling it to fit on fewer GPUs or be read from disk faster.

**8-bit floating point (FP8)** has been introduced in the latest hardware (NVIDIA Hopper GPUs). FP8 halves precision again, but getting LLMs to run in FP8 without accuracy drop is challenging – typically one might quantize weights to 8-bit but keep some higher precision for accumulation or certain sensitive layers. Qualcomm’s analysis suggests that from a hardware perspective **INT8 is more efficient than FP8** (FP8 arithmetic consumes ~50% more energy/area than INT8) (), so FP8’s advantage is mainly on the algorithmic side (ease of conversion from FP16) rather than raw efficiency. At present, FP8 inference is still an emerging area; early results show that with proper calibration or fine-tuning, **FP8 can work for transformers** with minimal accuracy loss, but some guard bands (like keeping LayerNorm in higher precision) may be needed. It’s likely that critical applications will stick to int8 or FP16 for now, while FP8 might see use in specialized accelerators or as a stepping stone to int4.

Beyond floats, there’s interest in mixed precision *within* a model: for example, using higher precision for the first and last layers or for the KV cache (if needed to preserve detail), and lower precision for intermediate layers. This kind of heterogeneous precision can be tuned to minimize any quality impact.

### Quantization to INT8, INT4, and Lower Bits

**Quantization** involves converting the model’s weights (and possibly activations) from floating-point to integer representations, often with a small set of scale factors. The primary motivation is to reduce memory and compute. **INT8 quantization** has become quite mature: Dettmers et al. (2022) introduced **LLM.int8()**, demonstrating that it’s possible to run 175B models in 8-bit with **no drop in performance** by handling outlier neurons specially ([LLM.int8(): 8-bit Matrix Multiplication for Transformers at Scale - arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07339#:~:text=arXiv arxiv,without any performance degradation)). The trick was to detect outlier weight values and keep those in higher precision (FP16) while quantizing the rest to int8, thus avoiding accuracy loss from those rare large magnitudes (). This outlier-aware method (and similar ones like ZeroQuant) enabled int8 inference to become commonplace. In practical terms, int8 reduces model memory by 2× and often improves speed on CPU by >2× (since CPUs have fast int8 vector instructions). On GPUs, int8 can also improve throughput if using Tensor Cores or DP4A operations, though on some GPUs FP16 is equally fast; on newer ones like Ampere/Hopper, int8 Tensor Core throughput is 2× FP16 rate, so it can speed up compute-bound layers.

**INT4 quantization** (4-bit) pushes this further, giving a 4× memory reduction over FP16. Running LLMs in 4-bit was once thought impossible without fine-tuning, but recent post-training quantization methods like **GPTQ (Frantar et al. 2022)** have shown surprising success. GPTQ can quantize a trained model to 4-bit weights while preserving most of its accuracy by minimizing the error introduced at each layer. Many LLaMA and GPT models have been quantized to 4-bit and evaluated – often the perplexity or benchmark score drops only slightly, e.g. a 7B model might lose a point of MMLU accuracy or a bit of BLEU on translation, but remain very usable. The trade-off is that int4 arithmetic is not as well-supported on GPUs; Hopper introduced FP8 but not int4 Tensor Cores (though there are techniques to pack two int4 into an int8 and use int8 hardware). Some accelerators (like Qualcomm Hexagon or Graphcore IPU) can execute int4 efficiently. When int4 is implemented, the speed-up can be substantial: memory bandwidth for weights is quartered, meaning layers that were bandwidth-bound speed up almost 4×. **SmoothQuant** (Xiao et al. 2023) is another method that enabled 8-bit activation quantization by scaling activation distributions, which in combination with 8-bit weights yields fully int8 execution (). Fully integer inference pipelines (even for Softmax and layernorm using quantized approximations) have been demonstrated as well ([I-LLM: Efficient Integer-Only Inference for Fully-Quantized Low-Bit...](https://openreview.net/forum?id=44pbCtAdLx#:~:text=I,efficient inference on hardware)).

However, quantization comes with **accuracy trade-offs** that need to be managed. While 8-bit can be essentially lossless for many models ([LLM.int8(): 8-bit Matrix Multiplication for Transformers at Scale - arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07339#:~:text=arXiv arxiv,without any performance degradation)), 4-bit usually introduces some loss in generation quality – it might manifest as slightly more repetitive or off-the-mark outputs for very large models, or reduced factual accuracy. Techniques like quantization-aware training (fine-tuning the model with quantization in the loop) can recover these losses at the cost of additional training. For instance, one might fine-tune a 70B LLM for a few thousand steps in 4-bit to regain most of its original performance. There’s active research into **3-bit or variable-bit** quantization: perhaps using 3 bits for most weights and 4 or 8 for critical layers (Adaptive Quant). Going below 4-bit starts to severely impact model quality unless significant retraining is done or model architecture is modified to be quantization-friendly (e.g. substituting non-linearities).

Quantization doesn’t only apply to weights; quantizing **activations** (the intermediate layer outputs) is important for hardware like TPUs or integer-only NPUs. As mentioned, SmoothQuant provided a method to quantize activations by distributing the quantization error between weights and activations via a balanced scaling (). This allowed the authors to run the whole transformer in int8 and showed negligible loss on tasks like translation. For edge devices, integer-only inference is desirable because it avoids any floating-point computation – some microcontrollers or low-power chips may not have FPUs, so running entirely in int8 or int4 is both faster and more energy efficient.

Speaking of energy: quantization yields not just speed but **power efficiency gains**. Each lower-bit operation consumes less electrical energy – an INT8 MAC can be 4× or more energy-efficient than FP32. Tesla (the company) famously said that running their car’s AI hardware at int8 vs fp16 made “a big difference” in power usage ([Elon: "It makes a big difference that we run inference at int8, which is ...](https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/162h7ny/elon_it_makes_a_big_difference_that_we_run/#:~:text=Elon%3A ,flat out not doing)). A detailed study showed that at the hardware level, an FP8 multiply is at least 50% less efficient in energy than an INT8 one (). Thus, int8 is something of a sweet spot: it combines significant compression with efficient hardware support. This is why nearly all mobile AI chips focus on int8 (and some int4) – e.g., the Apple Neural Engine, Qualcomm Hexagon, and Google’s Edge TPU are all designed around 8-bit operations for optimal performance per watt.

**Putting it together:** A common inference pipeline today might use *weight quantization* to 8-bit and *activation computation* in 16-bit. Some platforms (like ONNX Runtime with NNAPI on Android, or NVIDIA’s TensorRT) can do full int8 if the model is calibrated. With int8, a model uses half the memory and often sees a 1.5–2× throughput boost, especially if it was memory-bound ([LLM.int8(): 8-bit Matrix Multiplication for Transformers at Scale - arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07339#:~:text=arXiv arxiv,without any performance degradation)). With int4, memory usage drops by 4× – for example, the 70B LLaMA which is ~140 GB in FP16 can be ~35 GB in int4, a huge reduction that has enabled enthusiasts to run such models on prosumer GPUs that have 48 GB or less by trading some accuracy. Figure 1 (hypothetical) illustrates the trade-off between precision and performance.

*(Relative speed is hardware-dependent; FP16 vs FP32 is ~2× on tensor cores, INT8 vs FP16 can be ~1.3–1.5× on some GPUs, ~4× on CPUs with AVX512.)*

As shown, quantization provides diminishing returns – going from 32→16 bits is easy and gives big gains, 16→8 bits is usually doable with some care, and 8→4 bits yields big memory savings but comes with more challenges. In production, one might choose the lowest precision that still meets accuracy requirements for the application. For instance, a chatbot that needs to avoid any regression in coherence might stick to 8-bit, whereas a summarization model could be run in 4-bit if it still produces acceptable summaries, to save cost.

In closing, computation efficiency techniques like mixed precision and quantization are **low-hanging fruit** that every LLM deployment should consider. They often require just validation and perhaps a small calibration step to implement. Especially in edge scenarios, not exploiting quantization would leave significant speed and memory gains on the table. Even in cloud, the cost savings by halving memory and doubling throughput (with no extra hardware) are extremely attractive ([LLM.int8(): 8-bit Matrix Multiplication for Transformers at Scale - arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07339#:~:text=arXiv arxiv,without any performance degradation)). As a result, virtually all inference frameworks now have built-in support for quantization and precision control (TensorRT, OpenVINO, ONNX Runtime, PyTorch Accelerate, etc., all provide easy ways to run in 8-bit or 16-bit). Future trends might see hybrid quantization (some layers 8-bit, some 4-bit) and better algorithms for ultra-low precision (like **I-LLM** achieving fully integer inference ([I-LLM: Efficient Integer-Only Inference for Fully-Quantized Low-Bit...](https://openreview.net/forum?id=44pbCtAdLx#:~:text=I,efficient inference on hardware))). Combined with efficient architectures and scheduling, precision optimization ensures we get the maximum throughput per FLOP and per byte of memory in LLM inference.

## 6. Compiler and Runtime Optimizations

The final piece of the puzzle is the software that *actually executes* the model – namely, compilers and runtime engines that can turn the model graph into efficient code on the target hardware. A lot of the above techniques rely on having a flexible, powerful compiler to realize their benefits (e.g. fusing kernels for efficiency, or supporting new data types like BF16, or optimizing memory access for KV caches). We highlight some key compiler and runtime projects: Triton, MLIR-based frameworks, TVM, XLA, TensorRT, and others, and how they contribute to LLM inference efficiency.

### Custom Kernel Compilers (OpenAI Triton, etc.)

Many critical operations in LLMs (matrix multiplications, attention, layer normalization) can be hand-optimized at the CUDA level. **OpenAI Triton** is a DSL that allows writing custom GPU kernels in Python, which its compiler then optimizes and converts to PTX (GPU code). Triton enables experts to implement new optimized routines without writing low-level CUDA for each GPU architecture. For instance, the authors of **FlashAttention** used Triton to write a kernel that computes attention in a tiled fashion to avoid materializing the large attention matrix, achieving better speed and memory usage than the default implementation ([Compilers: Talking to The Hardware - Unify AI](https://unify.ai/blog/deep-learning-compilers#:~:text=Compilers%3A Talking to The Hardware,within neural networks into)). Because Triton abstracts away some of the CUDA complexity, developers can focus on high-level optimization (like how to split work into tiles that fit in shared memory) and let the compiler handle register allocation, etc. This has led to a proliferation of custom Triton kernels in the PyTorch ecosystem – e.g., kernels for layernorm, dropout, even GELU activation have Triton implementations that outperform the stock versions for certain sizes.

One advantage of such custom kernels is handling **dynamic shapes** and irregular computation more efficiently. Traditional deep learning compilers often expect static shapes (for ahead-of-time optimization), but inference workloads, especially with text generation, inherently involve dynamic sequence lengths. Triton kernels are just-in-time compiled for the shapes encountered, or written in a way that loops internally to handle variable lengths. For example, a Triton attention kernel might take sequence length as a parameter and be able to handle any length up to a maximum, instead of needing separate compiled variants for each possible length. This flexibility is important for LLM serving, where each request might be a different length and you don’t want to recompile or launch completely separate kernels for each. **Nvidia’s FasterTransformer** library contains highly optimized CUDA kernels for the transformer blocks (with fused attention, etc.), but those are pre-compiled for certain maximum sequence lengths, etc. Triton allows similar or better performance without sacrificing generality.

**Triton Inference Server** (not to be confused with Triton compiler) by NVIDIA is a serving system that automatically batches and routes inference requests, but also can integrate multiple backends (TensorRT, PyTorch, etc.). It offers dynamic batching and concurrent model execution. While not a compiler itself, it’s worth noting as a runtime that helps utilize GPUs well in deployment. For example, Triton Inference Server can batch incoming token requests from multiple users together and run a single optimized kernel, increasing GPU utilization for small workloads. It’s used in many cloud deployments to serve models at scale.

### MLIR and Heterogeneous Compilation (XLA, IREE, etc.)

**MLIR (Multi-Level IR)** is a compiler infrastructure by LLVM/Google that has increasingly been adopted to build deep learning compilers. It provides a flexible way to represent computations and apply transformations at various levels of abstraction (from high-level ops down to low-level loops). The significance of MLIR for LLM inference is that it enables development of **target-specific optimizations** and supports new hardware easily via custom dialects. For example, TensorFlow’s XLA compiler has been rebuilt on MLIR (using StableHLO as an MLIR dialect for XLA ops), and PyTorch’s new `torch.compile` mechanism uses Torch-MLIR and LLVM under the hood to generate code.

One major benefit of these compilers is **operator fusion** and graph-level optimization. In an LLM, a lot of time is spent in linear layers and elementwise ops. A compiler like XLA or TVM can fuse consecutive elementwise operations (e.g. bias add + gelu activation + dropout) into one kernel launch, saving memory bandwidth and kernel launch overhead. It can even fuse more complex patterns, such as the entire attention computation (Q*K^T + softmax + weighted V) into a single optimized kernel if shapes are known. Fusing reduces intermediate memory reads/writes and can improve speed by e.g. 1.2×–1.5× for transformer blocks (it was observed in some BERT inference optimizations that fusing LayerNorm and bias-add saved ~10% latency, for instance).

**Heterogeneous support:** MLIR-based compilers like **IREE (Google OpenXLA project)** can compile a model to multiple backends – CPU, GPU (via vulkan or CUDA), and even custom accelerators. This is useful for edge deployments, where you might want to compile the same model for different phones or hardware targets. For example, you could take a trained LLM and use IREE to generate a binary that runs on a Qualcomm Hexagon DSP using int8, and another for an NVIDIA GPU using Tensor Core code. IREE’s runtime can also partition execution between devices (though that’s more experimental). The high-level idea is “write once, run anywhere” by leveraging the MLIR compiler to retarget the model.

**XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra)**, although originally focused on static shapes, has been used successfully for inference of Transformer models in scenarios where input sizes are fixed or bounded (like BERT with max sequence length). XLA will fuse and optimize the computation, sometimes yielding significant speedups on TPUs and GPUs. However, for auto-regressive generation with varying lengths, XLA alone isn’t ideal because it would need to recompile for each new length. Instead, frameworks might use XLA for the large matmul ops and a flexible runtime for the loop. There is ongoing work to make XLA/MLIR handle dynamic shapes better – for instance, one could compile a “loop” that processes each token and have it optimized as a whole, not as separate calls.

### Advanced Graph Compilers: TVM, TensorRT, etc.

**Apache TVM** is an open-source deep learning compiler that uses auto-tuning to generate highly optimized code for a given model on a given hardware target. It breaks operations down to loop-level IR and tries various scheduling (tiling, unrolling, parallelization) to maximize performance, guided by a cost model or brute-force search. For LLMs, TVM can be applied to generate optimized kernels for things like the GEMMs or even the attention pattern. One strength of TVM is on exotic hardware or CPUs where vendor libraries are not well-optimized – for example, TVM has been used to optimize Transformers on ARM CPUs, achieving faster inference than stock TensorFlow by finding better cache-blocking parameters, etc. For GPU, TVM can approach cuDNN performance for convs and could potentially find better schedules for certain attention patterns that are not in cuBLAS.

However, applying TVM to very large models is non-trivial because the search space is enormous. Typically, you would use it for smaller blocks (like a single transformer layer) and rely on the repetitive structure of the model. Another nice feature is that TVM can handle *quantized models* by automatically generating integer kernels if you specify quantization in the model description. This is useful for edge hardware with specialized instructions.

**NVIDIA TensorRT** is a closed-source but widely used inference engine targeting NVIDIA GPUs. It takes a trained model (usually via ONNX format) and performs a series of optimizations: constant folding, layer fusion, precision lowering (with calibration for int8), and selects high-performance kernels for each operation. For Transformers, TensorRT has added specific optimizations – for instance, it supports a special “efficient attention” plugin, and more recently NVIDIA announced **TensorRT-LLM**, which includes support for features like KV cache management and even speculative decoding on Hopper GPUs ([TensorRT-LLM Speculative Decoding Boosts Inference Throughput ...](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/tensorrt-llm-speculative-decoding-boosts-inference-throughput-by-up-to-3-6x/#:~:text=TensorRT,LLMs) on NVIDIA)) ([TensorRT-LLM Speculative Decoding Boosts Inference Throughput ...](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/tensorrt-llm-speculative-decoding-boosts-inference-throughput-by-up-to-3-6x/#:~:text=TensorRT,LLMs) on NVIDIA)). Essentially, NVIDIA is baking a lot of LLM-specific knowledge into TensorRT so that users can get optimal performance without manual tuning. They claim substantial speedups on their hardware; for example, using TensorRT and its int8 mode, one can more than double throughput of GPT-2 compared to FP16 PyTorch.

One downside historically with TensorRT (and XLA, etc.) was **compilation time** for very large models. These compilers might take minutes to hours to optimize a 100B+ parameter model, which is not ideal if the model or sequence length changes frequently. To mitigate that, frameworks often keep a cache of compiled engines or use more dynamic approaches like TinyMS or ORT’s just-in-time. **ONNX Runtime (ORT)** with its TensorRT execution provider essentially serves as a bridge: you define the model in ONNX (possibly with some dynamic axes) and ORT will delegate as much as possible to TensorRT (for static parts) and handle dynamic parts itself.

**Other runtimes:** There are numerous others like **OpenVINO** for Intel CPUs/GPUs (which can optimize transformer ops with oneDNN), **ONE** compiler for Samsung NPUs, **CoreML** for Apple devices (with 16-bit and 8-bit support on ANE), and **Emerging AI accelerators** like Cerebras, SambaNova, Graphcore each with their own compiler. A common theme is that all these compilers are incorporating transformer-specific optimizations: e.g., skipping dropout at inference, fusing attention, supporting new ops like GeGLU efficiently, etc. As a result, an “optimized” deployment often uses a combination: perhaps a high-level library (like HuggingFace Transformers) for ease of use plus a backend like TensorRT or OpenVINO under the hood to accelerate the heavy ops.

One interesting development is **relational or SQL-based compilation** for models (a recent work proposed compiling LLM inference to a SQL query to run on a database engine ([[PDF\] Accessible and Portable LLM Inference by Compiling Computational ...](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02818#:~:text=,the most widely used)) ([[PDF\] Accessible and Portable LLM Inference by Compiling Computational ...](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02818#:~:text=,the most widely used))). While unconventional, it speaks to how we can leverage existing optimized systems in creative ways.

From the perspective of trends: **OpenXLA** is an initiative to unify a lot of these efforts (XLA, IREE, TensorRT through plugins) under a common interface. The idea is you express your model once (perhaps in a high-level IR) and these compilers target CPU, GPU, or even multi-host setups seamlessly. For LLMs, this could mean easier deployment across different hardware – e.g., compile once, run on Nvidia or AMD or TPU with similar performance. We’re not fully there yet, but MLIR is paving the way.

**In summary,** compilers and runtimes act as force multipliers for the other optimizations we discussed. If you quantize a model but your runtime can’t use int8 instructions, you gain nothing – so having engines like TensorRT that **fully exploit lower precision** is critical (). If you devise a new scheduling algorithm or architecture, you need a flexible compiler (like Triton or TVM) to implement it efficiently (e.g., a custom kernel for speculative decoding or an MLA attention op). The best results often come from co-designing models with compiler capabilities – for instance, the authors of TransMLA not only convert models to use latent attention, but also mention they plan to develop inference acceleration strategies for MLA ([TransMLA: Multi-head Latent Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07864v1#:~:text=incorporates an up,is performed to boost the)) ([TransMLA: Multi-head Latent Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.07864v1#:~:text=to adopt MLA,effective distillation of Deepseek R1)), which likely means writing custom kernels or compiler passes to realize its potential.

At the deployment level, choosing the right runtime can make a huge difference. A quick example: running a 6B model on CPU with naive PyTorch might be unusably slow, but the same model through Neural Magic’s **DeepSparse** engine (which leverages CPU sparsity and AVX512) or ONNX Runtime can be several times faster by using all threads and better cache management ([CPU Inference Server - DeepSparse - Neural Magic](https://neuralmagic.com/deepsparse/#:~:text=CPU Inference Server ,CV)). Or serving GPT-J on GPU via Triton Inference Server can automatically batch and parallelize requests better than a DIY approach. These tools continue to evolve, incorporating the latest research (for instance, after FlashAttention was published, both PyTorch and JAX integrated similar fused kernels in their libraries).

To sum up, modern LLM inference is as much a **compiler problem** as it is a model problem. By leaning on advanced compilers and runtime engines, practitioners can gain significant performance boosts: less overhead, more fusion, support for novel hardware, and the ability to execute optimized assembly that would be impractical to write by hand. Table 3 provides a quick comparison of some compiler/runtime options and their features relevant to LLMs:

This is not exhaustive, but it shows the landscape: some solutions focus on maximum performance (TensorRT), others on flexibility (TVM, IREE), and others on scaling out (DeepSpeed for multi-GPU). Often, a combination is used – e.g., one might use HuggingFace TGI which internally can utilize TensorRT for the heavy lifting. The bottom line is that the **software stack** for LLMs is rapidly maturing to handle the unique demands of these models, and leveraging these advancements is crucial to get state-of-the-art performance.

## 7. Benchmarks and Comparative Results

To concretely understand the impact of the various techniques discussed, it’s useful to look at **benchmark results** from the literature. Different optimizations target different metrics – some improve throughput (tokens or queries per second), some reduce latency (time to first token or per-token delay), others save memory or energy. We compile a few comparison points to illustrate the gains:

- **Throughput and Latency:** In high-load cloud scenarios, techniques that maximize parallelism shine. For example, vLLM’s PagedAttention showed **2–4× higher throughput** than prior systems at similar latency ([[2309.06180\] Efficient Memory Management for Large Language Model Serving with PagedAttention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180#:~:text=algorithm inspired by the classical,available at this https URL)), and up to **24× vs naive HF** for single-token batch ([vLLM: Easy, Fast, and Cheap LLM Serving with PagedAttention | vLLM Blog](https://blog.vllm.ai/2023/06/20/vllm.html#:~:text=Image    19,5x higher throughput than TGI)). Similarly, the Sarathi scheduler improved end-to-end throughput for large models by up to **5.6×** with its stall-free approach (). These big multipliers indicate that software inefficiencies, not hardware limits, were the bottleneck – and that the new methods unlocked performance that was already there in theory. On single-request latency, staged speculative decoding achieved a **3.16× speedup** in small batch decode time ([[2308.04623\] Accelerating LLM Inference with Staged Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04623#:~:text=diverse capabilities,while perfectly preserving output quality)), which is very promising for interactive applications.
- **Memory Efficiency:** PagedAttention essentially eliminated fragmentation, going from ~70% memory waste to ~<4% ([vLLM: Easy, Fast, and Cheap LLM Serving with PagedAttention | vLLM Blog](https://blog.vllm.ai/2023/06/20/vllm.html#:~:text=,reservation)) ([vLLM: Easy, Fast, and Cheap LLM Serving with PagedAttention | vLLM Blog](https://blog.vllm.ai/2023/06/20/vllm.html#:~:text=In PagedAttention%2C memory waste only,in the performance result above)). This means a server that previously could only fit, say, 5 long sequences in GPU memory could now fit ~twenty (almost linear scaling with memory saved), which directly translates to throughput. KV cache quantization (Oaken) reduced memory bandwidth needs such that an A100 with Oaken could outperform a stock A100 by ~1.6×, or potentially allow a cheaper GPU with quantization to match a more expensive GPU without ([Oaken: Fast and Efficient LLM Serving with Online-Offline Hybrid KV Cache Quantization](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.18599v1#:~:text=offline hybrid approach%2C setting outlier,incurring a minimal accuracy loss)). In MoE, expert buffering saved ~1.47× GPU memory by offloading inactive experts ([Toward Efficient Inference for Mixture of Experts | OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=stXtBqyTWX&noteId=p7ADDxdU8g#:~:text=for LM%2C 5.75,com%2Fhyhuang00%2Fmoe_inference)), allowing a model to run with fewer GPUs or enabling larger experts to be used given a fixed budget. And of course, int8 quantization halves model weight memory – one can load twice as many models on the same server, or serve a model twice as large from the same memory. These improvements often don’t show up as “speed” in a single-run benchmark, but they enable scaling to more users or bigger contexts, which is critical in practice.
- **Energy and Power:** Academic papers less frequently quantify power, but it is known that int8 can significantly reduce energy per inference. A Qualcomm study noted that for edge devices, int8 networks are *2–8× more efficient* than FP32 ones in terms of operations per joule (). NVIDIA has also indicated that using lower precision like int8 on Tensor Cores improves not just speed but also perf/Watt, which on a large cluster can reduce operating costs. If we consider an extreme edge case, running a 7B model on a smartphone CPU at FP16 vs int8 could be the difference between draining the battery quickly vs running within a thermal envelope. Power efficiency is also why some cloud providers look at FPGA or ASIC offload for certain parts (e.g., running the softmax on an FPGA to save GPU cycles/power).
- **Quality vs Speed Trade-offs:** Some benchmarks compare accuracy drop for a given speed gain. For quantization, Dettmers et al. showed **0% performance degradation** in language tasks going to 8-bit ([LLM.int8(): 8-bit Matrix Multiplication for Transformers at Scale - arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07339#:~:text=arXiv arxiv,without any performance degradation)), so that’s a free win. 4-bit might incur a small drop (e.g. +0.2 perplexity on WikiText, or a couple points on Winogrande) for ~2–3× speedup relative to FP16, which might be acceptable depending on requirements. Speculative decoding had *no quality loss* for a 3× speed gain ([[2308.04623\] Accelerating LLM Inference with Staged Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04623#:~:text=diverse capabilities,while perfectly preserving output quality)), again essentially free if you have the smaller draft model available. MoE dynamic gating presumably doesn’t change model quality (it’s an implementation improvement), but MoE models in general sometimes have slightly different accuracy vs dense. The big picture is that many optimizations manage to improve efficiency **without** hurting the model’s output, which is great. Where there is a trade-off (like quantization or smaller models), often a bit of fine-tuning or a smarter algorithm (SmoothQuant, GPTQ) can recover most of the gap.

To illustrate some of these comparisons, consider **Table 4**, which collates a few key results from different works on a common task (let’s say throughput in tokens/sec and latency in milliseconds for a given model):

| Model & Hardware             | Baseline (Naive)        | Optimized (Techniques)                                       | Improvement                                                  |

*(Above numbers are illustrative; actual performance varies by system. They show trends: e.g., memory optimization enabling OOM model to run, etc.)*

From the above, one sees that some optimizations primarily affect throughput (like PagedAttention allowed more parallelism), some affect latency (speculative decoding, chunking reduce waiting time), and some affect *feasibility* (offloading let a model run at all, albeit slowly). In a cloud setting, you typically want to maximize tokens/sec per dollar while keeping latency under a threshold – so something like vLLM or DeepSpeed that gives a big throughput boost is extremely valuable ([[2309.06180\] Efficient Memory Management for Large Language Model Serving with PagedAttention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180#:~:text=algorithm inspired by the classical,available at this https URL)). In an edge setting, you might be willing to sacrifice some throughput (since you only have one user) for lower latency or lower memory, hence using quantization and smaller models aggressively.

It’s also instructive to see **holistic benchmarks** that combine techniques. For instance, one could run a quantized model on vLLM with a fancy scheduler – these are not mutually exclusive. The state-of-the-art serving pipelines integrate many of these: e.g., an efficient setup for GPT-3 in 2025 might use a distilled or MoE-optimized model, 8-bit weights, an overlap-friendly pipeline schedule, and a Triton fused kernel library – each contributing maybe 2×, and multiplicatively resulting in an order of magnitude total gain.

Finally, **evaluation suites** like MLPerf Inference are starting to include NLP models (BERT, GPT-J) with scenarios for server and edge. In the latest results, we see big vendors demonstrating >10k sentences per second on BERT or extremely low latency on GPT-style tasks by leveraging all these tricks. Academic comparisons such as by Zhang et al. (2023) survey various inference optimizations and report latency/throughput on common hardware ([Large Language Model Inference Acceleration: A Comprehensive ...](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/384699184_Large_Language_Model_Inference_Acceleration_A_Comprehensive_Hardware_Perspective#:~:text=,we provide an overview)) – these surveys often conclude that no single technique is sufficient; rather, maximum efficiency comes from a **stacked approach** (optimized model + optimized runtime + right hardware).

For power, one can cite that a highly optimized int8 model on a specialized accelerator (like a 12nm “NorthPole” ASIC in one study) delivered **3-4× better energy efficiency** than an NVIDIA GPU on LLM inference ([[PDF\] Breakthrough low-latency, high-energy-efficiency LLM inference ...](https://modha.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/NorthPole_HPEC_LLM_2024.pdf#:~:text=[PDF] Breakthrough low,at various power)) ([[PDF\] Breakthrough low-latency, high-energy-efficiency LLM inference ...](https://modha.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/NorthPole_HPEC_LLM_2024.pdf#:~:text=With a focus on low,at various power)). That hints that there’s still room at the hardware level too, but that ventures beyond our scope into chip design.

## 8. Emerging Trends and Future Directions

The field of LLM inference is evolving quickly, and several **emerging trends** are worth noting:

- **Ultra-Long Context and Memory**: As LLMs start to support contexts of 100k tokens or more (e.g. Claude, GPT-4 128k), managing memory becomes paramount. Techniques like PagedAttention ([vLLM: Easy, Fast, and Cheap LLM Serving with PagedAttention | vLLM Blog](https://blog.vllm.ai/2023/06/20/vllm.html#:~:text=To address this problem%2C we,and fetches these blocks efficiently)) and KV cache streaming (DéjàVu) ([DéjàVu: KV-cache Streaming for Fast, Fault-tolerant Generative LLM Serving](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.01876v1#:~:text=and long recovery times in,large models across cloud deployments)) will be crucial, and we may see **hierarchical caching** (moving oldest tokens to slower memory, compressing past context) to handle these lengths. There’s also interest in models that can “forget” or summarize their context on the fly to avoid linear growth in memory.
- **Specialized Hardware and Model Co-Design**: New inference accelerators (like AWS Inferentia2, Google TPUv5, various startups) are often optimized for Transformer workloads. We might see LLM architectures adapt to better suit hardware – for instance, using more 8-bit friendly activations, or designing MoE with hardware routing support. The Qualcomm study on FP8 vs INT8 () suggests future hardware might skip FP8 and go directly for efficient int formats. **Analog compute** or optical computing for matmul could also become relevant if they prove more energy-efficient for large models.
- **Compiler Advancements**: The compiler frameworks will likely converge to handle dynamic LLM inference more seamlessly. We might get an XLA or TensorRT version that can handle the entire generate-loop as one compiled unit with dynamic shapes. Also, automated search (like TVM) might be applied to more parts of the model (e.g., finding the optimal tiling for multi-head attention on new hardware). **OpenAI is investing in Triton** and it could become the basis of a lot of custom ops for inference.
- **Speculative and Parallel Decoding**: Beyond the two-stage speculative decoding, there are ideas like **multiple hypothesis parallel decoding** (run N parallel decoders and pick the best output, trading off quality vs latency). Also, **tree-based decoding** could generate different parts of a response in parallel and then reconcile them. These approaches aim to break the inherent token-by-token sequential bottleneck for long outputs. If successful, they could reduce latency dramatically for long text generation – a major win for user experience.
- **Integration with Systems and Caching**: We’ll see LLM serving integrated with content delivery networks and caching layers. For example, if many users ask similar questions, the system might cache some answers or intermediate logits to reuse. Multi-tenant LMs might share partial computation across requests (some research shows identical prefix tokens’ KV can be shared ([vLLM: Easy, Fast, and Cheap LLM Serving with PagedAttention | vLLM Blog](https://blog.vllm.ai/2023/06/20/vllm.html#:~:text=PagedAttention has another key advantage%3A,shared between the output sequences))). This is akin to web caching but for model queries – a nascent idea in research.
- **On-Device Personalization**: As models run on edge (smartphones, laptops), there’s interest in on-device fine-tuning or adaptation (like LoRA) for personalization without sending data to cloud. This intersects training and inference: techniques like efficient low-bit fine-tuning (e.g. 8-bit Optimizer or QLoRA) allow a user to train a small adapter on-device. The inference engine then has to incorporate that quickly (possibly merging weights or using the runtime LoRA injection we discussed). The boundary between training and inference might blur for long-running systems that continuously learn.
- **Sparsity and Pruning at Runtime**: We might see *dynamic sparsity* where the model prunes different weights per input – e.g., skipping some attention heads or experts when they’re not needed for a simple query. Some research has looked at input-dependent pruning to speed up models (if a sentence is short, skip long-range attention). If combined with hardware support (skip zeros), this could yield efficient on-demand usage of model capacity.
- **Better Benchmarking and Auto-Tuning**: Currently, each new model or hardware often requires manual tuning of batch sizes, thread counts, etc. We anticipate more **auto-tuning** where the serving system profiles and adjusts itself (like how a database optimizer works). MLPerf is expanding to capture more LLM use-cases, which will drive competition and improvements. We’ll likely get standardized benchmarks for multi-user chat latency, etc., pushing the community to improve holistic performance (not just single-model throughput, but QoS under load).
- **Energy-Aware Scheduling**: In data centers, if certain GPUs are more energy-efficient at lower utilization, the scheduler might favor spreading load vs packing it, etc. And on edge, scheduling when to run a model (immediately vs wait a few ms for possible batch, or run on CPU vs NPU depending on thermal state) could be a dynamic decision. This could be aided by lightweight models that predict the cost/benefit of waiting or offloading – an interesting area for future research.
- **Continual Evaluation and Monitoring**: As models get optimized aggressively, ensuring they still produce correct outputs is key. We might see inference pipelines with integrated validators or confidence estimators that ensure quantization or pruning hasn’t caused a mistake for critical queries (and if so, maybe re-run that query in high precision as a fallback). This kind of selective precision approach could give the best of both worlds: mostly fast/low-precision, but high-precision on the fly when needed.

In conclusion, the quest for efficient LLM inference is driving innovation across the stack – from theoretical model designs down to hardware circuits. The **cloud-edge dichotomy** means methods must be adaptable: cloud solutions prioritize throughput and scalability (often via parallelism and distributing load), whereas edge solutions prioritize low latency and low resource usage (often via model compression and specialization). But increasingly, techniques developed for one are informing the other. For instance, a paging algorithm (from cloud OS concepts) helps on-device memory use, and an int8 acceleration (from mobile chips) helps reduce cloud TCO. The synergy of these techniques, as we’ve detailed, is enabling the deployment of ever more powerful LLMs in a cost-effective way.

As LLMs continue to grow in capability, the importance of efficient inference will only magnify – making this an exciting and vital area of research and engineering. The emerging trends suggest a future where huge models can be served at interactive speeds, maybe even on personal devices, through a combination of smart algorithms and robust systems engineering. Each piece – KV cache mgmt, LoRA serving, scheduling, architecture, precision, compilers – contributes to the overall puzzle of making LLMs practical and ubiquitous in real-world applications.
